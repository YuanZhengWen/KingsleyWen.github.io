 Welcome to my homepage! I am Yuanzheng Wen (文渊正) or Kingsley, currently an undergraduate student at Department of Geophysics and Space Sciences, School of Geophysics, Chengdu University of Technology, China.
 
 I will try to keep my website frequently updated and make it better! 
 
 You can also follow my Github, Twitter and Facebook in the "Follow" section. 
 
## Research Interests
As an undergraduate student, I am still exploring my research interests, as for now I have been involved in research about

- [Seismic Ionospheric Anomalies](#seismic-ionospheric-anomalies)
- [Planetatr Space Physics (About Mars)](#planetary-space-physics-(about-mars))

### Seismic Ionospheric Anomalies

Earthquakes can excite atmospheric and ionospheric disturbances by dynamic coupling: vertical vibrations of the Earth’s surface launch pressure waves in the neutral atmosphere that grow in amplitude by several orders of magnitude as they attain ionospheric heights. Thus ionospheric anomalies can be regarded as an earthquake precursor, I am working with Dr. Dan Tao to investigate the Total Electron Content (TEC) and plasma parameters (electron, ion density and temperature) anomlies and aim to find out the correlations between ionospheric anomalies and strong earthquakes.

### Planetatry Space Physics (About Mars)

The Mars of several billion years ago is a very differnt Mars than that of today. Several billion years ago, Mars was geologically active from core to crust, possessed a much thicker atmosphere, and had an internally produced magnetic field. The solar wind interaction with Mars plays a crucial role in Martian atmospheric evolution, I am working with Dr.Yiteng Zhang on solar wind interaction with Mars and ion escape process to gain a better understanding of Martian atmopsheric escape process.
