 Welcome to my homepage! I am Yuanzheng Wen (文渊正) or Kingsley, currently an undergraduate student at Department of Geophysics and Space Sciences, School of Geophysics, Chengdu University of Technology, China.
 
 I will try to keep my website frequently updated and make it better!

Research Interests
======
As an undergraduate student, I am still exploring my research interests, as for now I may tend to conduct research about
* [Seismic Ionospheric Anomalies](#Seismic Ionospheric Anomalies)
* [Planetary Space Physics (About Mars)](#Planetary Space Physics (About Mars))
* Planetary Sciences

### Seismic Ionospheric Anomalies

### Planetatr Space Physics (About Mars)

The Mars of several billion years ago is a very differnt Mars than that of today. Several billion years ago, Mars was geologically active from core to crust, possessed a much thicker atmosphere, and had an internally produced magnetic field. The solar wind interaction with Mars plays a crucial role in Martian atmospheric evolution, I am working with Dr.Yiteng Zhang on solar wind interaction with Mars and ion escape process to gain a better understanding of Martian atmopsheric escape process.
