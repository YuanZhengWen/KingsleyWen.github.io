 Welcome to my homepage! I am Yuanzheng Wen (文渊正) or Kingsley, currently an undergraduate student at Department of Geophysics and Space Sciences, School of Geophysics, Chengdu University of Technology, China.
 
 I will try to keep my website frequently updated and make it better!

## Research Projects
As an undergraduate student, I am still exploring my research interests, as for now I have been involved in research about

- [Seismic Ionospheric Anomalies](#seismic-ionospheric-anomalies)
- [MHD Simulation of Solar Wind Interaction with Mars](#mhd-simulation-of-solar-wind-interaction-with-mars)
- [Investigations of Martian Tail Boudary Layer with Mars Express ASPERA-3](#investigations-of-martian-tail-boundary-layer-with-mars-express-aspera-3)
- [Statistical Investigations of IMF Impact on Current Sheet Structure in Martian Magnetotail](#statistical-investigations-of-imf-impact-on-current-sheet-structure-in-martian-magnetotail)

### Seismic Ionospheric Anomalies

Earthquakes can excite atmospheric and ionospheric disturbances by dynamic coupling: vertical vibrations of the Earth’s surface launch pressure waves in the neutral atmosphere that grow in amplitude by several orders of magnitude as they attain ionospheric heights. Thus ionospheric anomalies can be regarded as an earthquake precursor, I am working with Dr. Dan Tao to investigate the Total Electron Content (TEC) and plasma parameters (electron, ion density and temperature) anomlies prior to earthquakes and aim to find out the correlations between ionospheric anomalies and strong earthquakes. The project is finished, manuscript has been submitted to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/advances-in-space-research">Advances in Space Research.

### MHD Simulation of Solar Wind Interaction with Mars

The Mars of several billion years ago is a very differnt Mars than that of today. Several billion years ago, Mars was geologically active from core to crust, possessed a much thicker atmosphere, and had an internally produced magnetic field. The solar wind interaction with Mars plays a crucial role in Martian atmospheric evolution. Through the "Undergraduates Research Program" funded by Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), I am able to work with Dr.Yiteng Zhang at  <a href="http://www.nssc.ac.cn/"> National Space Science Center (NSSC)</a> on MHD simulation of solar wind interaction with Mars (ion escape process) to gain a better understanding of Martian atmopsheric escape process and planetary evolution history.

### Investigations of Martian Tail Boundary Layer with Mars Express ASPERA-3
  
In spacecraft (MEX, MAVEN) statistical data we can see a broad region of mixing of solar wind and planetary ions at the boundary of the Martian tail. From statistics we cannot tell if this is flaring, ie.e the tail boundary moves back and forth, so that the average becomes mixed, or a true mixing of plasma. The latter would be.a signature of boundary mixing processes like the Kelvin Helmholtz instability. Using moment data this is straightforward to investigate. Moment data from Mars Express does have some shortcomings to get accurate absolute numbers, mainly because of a partial field of view. We have better coverage tail data going deeper in the tail and also for a much longer time period from the Mars Express  <a href="http://aspera-3.irf.se/">ASPERA-3</a> IMA instrument, which will be used in our investagtions. I am collaborating with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=37m29h8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Prof. Hans Nilsson</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=KTB3pgYAAAAJ">Prof. Mats Holmstrom</a> at <a href="https://www.irf.se/en/">Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF)</a> on this exciting project.

### Statistical Investigations of IMF Impact on Current Sheet Structure in Martian Magnetotail
An earlier statistical survey suggested that the flow-aligned component of upstream interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may play an important role in controlling the lobe asymmetries of the Venusian magnetotail. The tail current sheet would be displaced and the magnetic field configuration would show asymmetries with respect to the current sheet. The asymmetries are expected to be more evident when the flow-aligned component becomes dominant. With carefully selected cases as well as a statistical study based on MAVEN observations in the near-Mars tail, we intend to investigate the flow-aligned component of IMF impact on current sheet structure in the Martian magnetotail. I am currently working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QimEmw8AAAAJ&hl=en-CN&oi=ao">Prof. Zhaojin Rong</a> at Key Laboratory of Earth and Planetary Physics, <a href="http://english.igg.cas.cn/">Institute of Geology and Geophysics</a>, Chinese Academy of Sciences on this project.
